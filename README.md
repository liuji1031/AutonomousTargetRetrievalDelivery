# Autonomous target retrieval and delivery
This is the repository for all the code I developed for the course ENPM809T Autonomous Robot.

In this course I built and programmed an autonomous robot from scratch and the final task (grand challenge) is to search for and deliver red, green and blue blocks (in this sequence) to a construction zone.
